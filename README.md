If you want to test in your local machine, just clone, modify the Project info and run.
If you want to test in your code:
 - copy and paste the ZoomTransitioningDelegate to your project
 - implements the Delegate in your initial ViewController as shown:
 
 ```
func zoomingBackgroundView(for transition: ZoomTransitioningDelegate) -> UIView? {
        return nil
    }
    
    func zoomingImageView(for transition: ZoomTransitioningDelegate) -> UIImageView? {
        if let indexPath = selectedIndexPath {
            let cell = collectionView?.cellForItem(at: indexPath) as! CollectionViewCell
            return cell.imageView
        }
        
        return nil
    }
 ```
 - implements the Delegate in your final ViewController like this:
 
 ```
 func zoomingBackgroundView(for transition: ZoomTransitioningDelegate) -> UIView? {
        return nil
    }
    
    func zoomingImageView(for transition: ZoomTransitioningDelegate) -> UIImageView? {
        return imageView
    }
